# Detailed Explanation of the Trapezoidal Rule Integration Program

## Overview of the Trapezoidal Rule

The trapezoidal rule approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into subintervals and approximating the function in each subinterval with a linear function (forming a trapezoid). Mathematically, for an integral $\int_a^b f(x)dx$, the trapezoidal approximation is:

$$\int_a^b f(x)dx \approx \frac{h}{2}\left[f(a) + f(b) + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(a+ih)\right]$$

where $h = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and $n$ is the number of subintervals.

### Variable Declarations

```fortran
! Integration limits
real(kind=8) :: a, b         ! Lower and upper bounds of integration
  
! Computational parameters
integer :: n                 ! Number of subintervals
integer :: i                 ! Loop counter
real(kind=8) :: h            ! Step size (width of each subinterval)
real(kind=8) :: x            ! Current x value
real(kind=8) :: result       ! Final result of integration
real(kind=8) :: exact        ! Exact value of the integral (if known)
real(kind=8) :: error        ! Absolute error
```

Key aspects of the variable declarations:

- `real(kind=8)` specifies double precision floating-point variables for high numerical accuracy
- Integration boundaries (`a` and `b`) are declared as double precision
- Computational variables are clearly named and commented
- Variables for storing results and error metrics are included

### Input Parameter Setup

```fortran
a = 0.0d0       ! Lower bound
b = 1.0d0       ! Upper bound
```

The integration interval is set from 0 to 1. The `d0` suffix designates double precision constants. Mixed precision custom constants can also be defined for advanced users. 

### Output Formatting Setup

```fortran
fmt_header = '(A10, A15, A15, A15)'
fmt_result = '(I10, F15.8, F15.8, E15.8)'
```

Format strings for output are defined:

- `fmt_header` formats the column headers with appropriate spacing
- `fmt_result` formats numeric results with controlled precision:
  - `I10`: Integer with width 10
  - `F15.8`: Fixed-point representation with width 15 and 8 decimal places
  - `E15.8`: Scientific notation with width 15 and 8 decimal places

### Convergence Study Loop

```fortran
do n = 10, 1000, 100
  ! Implementation here
end do
```

The program performs a convergence study by executing the trapezoidal rule with increasing numbers of subintervals, starting at 10 and increasing by 100 up to 1000.

### Trapezoidal Rule Implementation

```fortran
! Calculate step size
h = (b - a) / real(n, kind=8)

! Initialize result with function values at endpoints (with weight 1/2)
result = 0.5d0 * (f(a) + f(b))

! Add contribution from interior points
do i = 1, n-1
  x = a + i*h
  result = result + f(x)
end do

! Multiply by step size
result = h * result
```

This section implements the trapezoidal rule formula:

1. Calculate the subinterval width `h`
2. Initialize the result with half the sum of the function values at the endpoints
3. Sum the function values at all interior points
4. Multiply by the step size to get the final result

This directly implements the mathematical formula for the trapezoidal rule.

### Error Calculation

```fortran
exact = (1.0d0/3.0d0) - 2.0d0*cos(1.0d0) + 2.0d0
error = abs(result - exact)
```

For the specific function being integrated (x² + 2·sin(x)), the exact analytical solution is calculated and used to determine the absolute error of the numerical approximation.

### Detailed Calculation Demonstration

```fortran
n = 100
print *
print *, "DETAILED CALCULATION FOR", n, "INTERVALS"
```

After the convergence study, the program demonstrates a detailed calculation for a specific number of intervals (100), showing the contribution from each subinterval.

```fortran
do i = 0, n-1
  real(kind=8) :: x_left, x_right, f_left, f_right, area
  
  x_left = a + i*h
  x_right = a + (i+1)*h
  f_left = f(x_left)
  f_right = f(x_right)
  area = 0.5d0 * (f_left + f_right) * h
  
  write(*, '(I8, 2F10.5, 2F10.5, F10.8)') i+1, x_left, x_right, f_left, f_right, area
  
  ! Accumulate the result
  result = result + area
end do
```

This loop:

1. Calculates the left and right x-coordinates of each subinterval
2. Evaluates the function at these coordinates
3. Calculates the area of the resulting trapezoid: 0.5 * (f_left + f_right) * h
4. Displays these values in a formatted table
5. Accumulates the total integral value

### Function Definition

```fortran
contains
  function f(x) result(y)
    real(kind=8), intent(in) :: x
    real(kind=8) :: y
    
    ! Define the function to be integrated: f(x) = x^2 + 2*sin(x)
    y = x**2 + 2.0d0 * sin(x)
  end function f
```

The function to be integrated is defined as an internal function within the program using the `contains` keyword. The function is declared with:

- An `intent(in)` attribute for the input parameter, indicating it will not be modified
- Double precision for both input and output
- The mathematical definition x² + 2·sin(x)
